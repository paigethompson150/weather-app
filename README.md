## Weather App

### Description
I used the OpenWeatherMap API, ES6 modules and webpack to create a responsive website that will generate the current weather forecast of a city or town that the user inputs into the search bar. The user has the ability to toggle the weather between imperial and metric units.

08/31/22: I noticed there's an issue with the openWeatherMapAPI request not loading - to fix that, you'll have to go to site settings -> permissions -> insecure content -> allow. Sorry about that! :(
